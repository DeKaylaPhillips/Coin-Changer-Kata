# Coin-Changer-Kata

Simple program that outputs the coin denominations and amount of each coin necessary to sum to the total amount of change, while using the least amount of coins as possible. 

Details: involves writing a program that takes an amount of change as an input (example: 33 cents) and as an ouput provides the most efficient way to give that as change by each type of coin (example: 33 cents would be 1 quarter, 1 nickel, 3 pennies).

When completed, the program should be able to take any amount of change (1 through 100) and provide the breakdown by coins.

Practice this by doing it many times, each time deleting your code and starting again. Write it, delete it, start again. The aim here is to practice the habit of writing tests, verifying your code works as intended, and progressing from there.
